# MCP Center

MCP Center is a local MCP gateway with a built-in Web UI. It manages multiple child MCP servers, keeps their configuration in one place, and exposes a single Streamable HTTP MCP endpoint for your MCP client to connect to.

MCP Center can aggregate capabilities from:

- HTTP MCP servers
- local stdio MCP servers
- WebSocket bridge clients that connect back to MCP Center

It currently republishes these MCP capabilities through the main endpoint:

- tools
- resources
- resource templates
- prompts

> WebSocket bridge clients currently contribute tools only. Resources, resource templates, and prompts from WebSocket bridge clients are not exposed.

To avoid collisions, every exposed capability is prefixed with the child server name:

- tool: `exa_web_search_exa`
- resource: `filesystem_file:///tmp/a.txt`
- prompt: `docs_summarize`
- WebSocket bridge tool: `my_agent_search`

## Usage Model

Run MCP Center directly with `npx`, then connect your MCP client to the HTTP endpoint it starts:

1. Start `mcp-center` with `npx @yan-sheng-li/mcp-center`
2. Open the Web UI to add or edit HTTP/stdio child MCP servers
3. Optionally let remote/local agents connect as WebSocket bridge clients
4. Point your MCP client at `http://localhost:3000/mcp`

## Quick Start

### 1. Start MCP Center

```bash
npx @yan-sheng-li/mcp-center
```

This command executes the package's CLI entry directly. No global install is required.

By default it uses `~/.mcp-center/mcp.json`. If the file does not exist, it will be created automatically as:

```json
{
  "servers": []
}
```

You can also pass a custom config path:

```bash
npx @yan-sheng-li/mcp-center --config /path/to/mcp.json
```

Or:

```bash
npx @yan-sheng-li/mcp-center /path/to/mcp.json
```

### 2. Open the Web UI

Open:

```text
http://localhost:3000/ui
```

From the UI you can:

- add HTTP or stdio child MCP servers
- edit server config
- enable or disable a configured server
- delete a configured server
- probe a server before saving to inspect tools/resources/templates/prompts
- selectively enable only part of a configured server's capabilities
- view connection status and loaded capabilities
- view connected WebSocket bridge clients as read-only, auto-registered servers

### 3. Connect your MCP client to MCP Center

Use this endpoint:

```text
http://localhost:3000/mcp
```

Your MCP client must support Streamable HTTP transport.

## Server Profiles

MCP Center supports **server profiles** for scene-based switching. Create profiles to define which servers are enabled for different use cases:

- Create a profile with a subset of servers (e.g., "Writing" profile with only docs/search tools)
- Quickly switch between profiles without manually toggling individual servers
- Useful when you need different server combinations for different tasks

### Profile Operations

From the Web UI (http://localhost:3000/ui):

- Click "+ New Profile" to create a profile and select which servers to include
- Click "Manage Profiles" to edit, delete, or activate/deactivate profiles
- Click the profile dropdown to quickly switch between profiles

### Profile API

- `GET /api/profiles` - list all profiles and active profile
- `POST /api/profiles` - create a new profile
- `PUT /api/profiles/:name` - update a profile
- `DELETE /api/profiles/:name` - delete a profile
- `POST /api/profiles/activate` - activate a profile (enables only selected servers)
- `POST /api/profiles/deactivate` - deactivate profile (enable all servers)

## Backup & Restore

MCP Center supports exporting and restoring your configuration and usage data:

- Export a ZIP backup containing `mcp.json` and `stats.db`
- Import a backup ZIP to restore configuration
- Useful for migrating to a new machine or backing up before major changes

### Backup Operations

From the Web UI (http://localhost:3000/ui):

- Click "Backup" to download a timestamped ZIP backup
- Click "Restore" to upload and restore from a backup ZIP

### Backup API

- `GET /api/backup/export` - download backup ZIP
- `POST /api/backup/import` - upload and restore from ZIP

## Statistics Dashboard

MCP Center tracks tool usage and provides a visual dashboard:

- Overview of total calls, unique tools, and active servers
- Per-tool usage statistics and call counts
- Timeline chart showing usage over time
- Recent call history

### Access Dashboard

Open `http://localhost:3000/dashboard` to view the statistics dashboard with ECharts visualizations.

### Stats API

- `GET /api/stats/overview` - overview statistics (total calls, unique tools, active servers)
- `GET /api/stats/tools` - per-tool usage statistics
- `GET /api/stats/timeline` - usage over time
- `GET /api/stats/recent` - recent call history
- Optional `?period=24h|7d|30d` query parameter (default: 24h)

## WebSocket Bridge

MCP Center also starts a WebSocket bridge server on the same port:

```text
ws://localhost:3000/ws/:serverName
```

A WebSocket bridge client connects to this URL and behaves like a lightweight MCP server over a JSON-RPC WebSocket connection. MCP Center performs an MCP-style handshake, lists the client's tools, auto-registers the connected client as a server, and exposes those tools through the normal Streamable HTTP MCP endpoint at `/mcp`.

This is useful when a tool provider cannot be launched by MCP Center as stdio and cannot be reached as an HTTP MCP server, for example:

- a browser extension or desktop app that can open an outbound WebSocket connection
- a remote worker behind NAT/firewall that can connect out to MCP Center
- a long-running app that wants to dynamically publish tools while it is connected

### Bridge lifecycle

1. Start MCP Center.
2. A bridge client connects to `ws://localhost:3000/ws/<serverName>`.
3. MCP Center sends `initialize` to the bridge client.
4. MCP Center sends `tools/list` to discover tools.
5. The bridge client appears in the Web UI as a `WSBRIDGE` server.
6. Tools are exposed to MCP clients with the same server-name prefix rule, for example `agent1_echo`.
7. When an MCP client calls that tool through `/mcp`, MCP Center forwards a `tools/call` request over the WebSocket.
8. When the WebSocket disconnects, the bridge server is removed from the loaded capability list.

If another WebSocket connects with the same `serverName`, the previous connection for that name is closed and replaced.

### Bridge protocol

The bridge connection uses JSON-RPC 2.0 messages over WebSocket.

After the WebSocket upgrade, MCP Center sends:

```json
{
  "jsonrpc": "2.0",
  "id": 1,
  "method": "initialize",
  "params": {
    "protocolVersion": "2025-03-26",
    "capabilities": {},
    "clientInfo": {
      "name": "mcp-center",
      "version": "1.0.0"
    }
  }
}
```

The bridge client should return a JSON-RPC result, for example:

```json
{
  "jsonrpc": "2.0",
  "id": 1,
  "result": {
    "protocolVersion": "2025-03-26",
    "capabilities": {
      "tools": {}
    },
    "serverInfo": {
      "name": "my-agent",
      "version": "1.0.0"
    }
  }
}
```

MCP Center then sends `tools/list`:

```json
{
  "jsonrpc": "2.0",
  "id": 2,
  "method": "tools/list"
}
```

The bridge client should return tools in normal MCP shape:

```json
{
  "jsonrpc": "2.0",
  "id": 2,
  "result": {
    "tools": [
      {
        "name": "echo",
        "description": "Echo input text",
        "inputSchema": {
          "type": "object",
          "properties": {
            "text": {
              "type": "string"
            }
          },
          "required": ["text"]
        }
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

When an MCP client calls the exposed tool, for example `my_agent_echo`, MCP Center forwards the original tool name to the bridge client:

```json
{
  "jsonrpc": "2.0",
  "id": 3,
  "method": "tools/call",
  "params": {
    "name": "echo",
    "arguments": {
      "text": "hello"
    }
  }
}
```

The bridge client should return a normal MCP tool result:

```json
{
  "jsonrpc": "2.0",
  "id": 3,
  "result": {
    "content": [
      {
        "type": "text",
        "text": "hello"
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

If a request fails, return a JSON-RPC error:

```json
{
  "jsonrpc": "2.0",
  "id": 3,
  "error": {
    "code": -32000,
    "message": "Something went wrong"
  }
}
```

### Minimal bridge client example

Install `ws` in your client project, then run this script while MCP Center is running:

```js
import WebSocket from 'ws';

const serverName = 'demo-agent';
const ws = new WebSocket(`ws://localhost:3000/ws/${encodeURIComponent(serverName)}`);

const tools = [
  {
    name: 'echo',
    description: 'Echo input text',
    inputSchema: {
      type: 'object',
      properties: {
        text: { type: 'string' }
      },
      required: ['text']
    }
  }
];

ws.on('open', () => {
  console.log(`Connected to MCP Center as ${serverName}`);
});

ws.on('message', (data) => {
  const msg = JSON.parse(data.toString());
  if (!msg || msg.jsonrpc !== '2.0' || msg.id == null) return;

  if (msg.method === 'initialize') {
    ws.send(JSON.stringify({
      jsonrpc: '2.0',
      id: msg.id,
      result: {
        protocolVersion: msg.params?.protocolVersion || '2025-03-26',
        capabilities: { tools: {} },
        serverInfo: { name: serverName, version: '1.0.0' }
      }
    }));
    return;
  }

  if (msg.method === 'tools/list') {
    ws.send(JSON.stringify({
      jsonrpc: '2.0',
      id: msg.id,
      result: { tools }
    }));
    return;
  }

  if (msg.method === 'tools/call') {
    const { name, arguments: args = {} } = msg.params || {};
    if (name === 'echo') {
      ws.send(JSON.stringify({
        jsonrpc: '2.0',
        id: msg.id,
        result: {
          content: [
            { type: 'text', text: String(args.text ?? '') }
          ]
        }
      }));
    } else {
      ws.send(JSON.stringify({
        jsonrpc: '2.0',
        id: msg.id,
        error: { code: -32601, message: `Unknown tool: ${name}` }
      }));
    }
  }
});

ws.on('close', () => console.log('Disconnected from MCP Center'));
ws.on('error', (err) => console.error('WebSocket error:', err));
```

After the script connects, open `http://localhost:3000/ui`. You should see `demo-agent` with type `WSBRIDGE`. MCP clients connected to `http://localhost:3000/mcp` can call the tool as:

```text
demo-agent_echo
```

### WebSocket bridge notes and limits

- Bridge servers are not stored in `mcp.json`; they are auto-registered while connected.
- Bridge servers are shown in the UI as read-only entries.
- Only tools are loaded from bridge clients.
- Tool calls over the bridge time out after 60 seconds.
- Handshake/list requests time out after 15 seconds.
- MCP Center sends WebSocket ping frames every 30 seconds as keepalive.
- Server names are taken from the URL path and sanitized only when constructing aggregated tool names: characters outside `[a-zA-Z0-9_-]` become `_`.
- There is no authentication or authorization on `/ws/:serverName` in the current implementation. If exposing MCP Center beyond localhost, put it behind a trusted network boundary or reverse proxy that enforces access control.

## How It Works

MCP Center acts as a proxy in front of multiple child servers:

- configured child servers can be HTTP MCP servers or local stdio MCP servers
- WebSocket bridge clients can connect dynamically without being added to config
- MCP Center connects to configured child servers as a client
- MCP Center lists their capabilities and republishes them through one HTTP endpoint
- calls and reads are forwarded to the original child server or bridge client

Capability filtering is applied per configured HTTP/stdio child server:

- `enabledTools`
- `enabledResources`
- `enabledResourceTemplates`
- `enabledPrompts`

If a filtering field is omitted or empty, MCP Center exposes all items of that type from that child server.

Filtering does not apply to WebSocket bridge clients because they are not stored in the config file.

## Configuration File

The config file format is:

```json
{
  "servers": [
    {
      "name": "exa",
      "url": "https://mcp.exa.ai/mcp",
      "httpHeaders": {
        "Authorization": "Bearer YOUR_TOKEN"
      },
      "enabledTools": ["web_search_exa"]
    },
    {
      "name": "filesystem",
      "command": "npx",
      "args": [
        "-y",
        "@modelcontextprotocol/server-filesystem",
        "/path/to/workspace"
      ],
      "env": {
        "NODE_ENV": "production"
      },
      "enabledTools": ["read_file", "write_file"],
      "enabledResources": ["file:///path/to/workspace/README.md"],
      "enabledPrompts": ["summarize_file"]
    }
  ]
}
```

### Server Fields

Common fields:

- `name`: required, must be unique
- `enabled`: optional, set `false` to keep the server in config but not connect to it
- `enabledTools`: optional string array
- `enabledResources`: optional string array
- `enabledResourceTemplates`: optional string array
- `enabledPrompts`: optional string array

HTTP child server fields:

- `url`: required for HTTP transport
- `httpHeaders`: optional request headers

STDIO child server fields:

- `command`: required for stdio transport
- `args`: optional argument array
- `env`: optional environment variables, merged with the current process environment

WebSocket bridge clients do not use config fields. They connect directly to `/ws/:serverName`.

## Client Configuration

The exact client config depends on the client, but the target should be the MCP Center HTTP endpoint:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "mcp-center": {
      "url": "http://localhost:3000/mcp"
    }
  }
}
```

If your client expects a transport field, use its Streamable HTTP mode and point it to the same URL.

If you want to launch MCP Center from another tool or script, use the same `npx` entry:

```json
{
  "command": "npx",
  "args": [
    "-y",
    "@yan-sheng-li/mcp-center"
  ]
}
```

## HTTP API

The Web UI uses these routes:

- `GET /api/servers`: list configured HTTP/stdio servers
- `POST /api/servers`: add a configured server
- `PUT /api/servers/:index`: update a configured server
- `DELETE /api/servers/:index`: delete a configured server
- `PATCH /api/servers/:index/toggle`: enable or disable a configured server
- `GET /api/servers/status`: get current connection status
- `GET /api/servers/:name/capabilities`: get loaded capabilities for a connected server
- `GET /api/wsbridge/servers`: list currently connected WebSocket bridge servers
- `POST /api/probe`: temporarily connect to a server config and inspect capabilities before saving

Profile API:
- `GET /api/profiles`: list all profiles and active profile
- `POST /api/profiles`: create a new profile
- `PUT /api/profiles/:name`: update a profile
- `DELETE /api/profiles/:name`: delete a profile
- `POST /api/profiles/activate`: activate a profile
- `POST /api/profiles/deactivate`: deactivate profile

Backup API:
- `GET /api/backup/export`: download backup ZIP
- `POST /api/backup/import`: upload and restore from ZIP

Stats API:
- `GET /api/stats/overview`: overview statistics
- `GET /api/stats/tools`: per-tool usage statistics
- `GET /api/stats/timeline`: usage over time
- `GET /api/stats/recent`: recent call history

## Runtime Behavior

- Default port is `3000`
- Set `PORT` to change it
- HTTP MCP endpoint: `http://localhost:<port>/mcp`
- Web UI: `http://localhost:<port>/ui`
- WebSocket bridge endpoint: `ws://localhost:<port>/ws/:serverName`
- The config file is watched for changes
- When the config changes, MCP Center reloads configured child servers automatically
- Child servers are loaded in parallel
- Failed configured child servers do not stop the main HTTP/WebSocket service from starting

Example:

```bash
PORT=8080 npx @yan-sheng-li/mcp-center
```

PowerShell:

```powershell
$env:PORT=8080
npx @yan-sheng-li/mcp-center
```
